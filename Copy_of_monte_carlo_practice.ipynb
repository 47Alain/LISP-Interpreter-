As for the output, we want to return a list of length 3, each index `i` representing our points this iteration if we toss `my_cards[i]`. We assign winning `1` point, drawing `0.5` points, and losing `0` points (note that this does not have to be the case, it is simply a design choice). Additionally, we will assume that our opponent chooses uniformly at random for any toss action they perform (again, a design choice).\n",

The function will return a number, and the greater the number, the better the best 5-card hand from `available_cards`. Good luck!  "
